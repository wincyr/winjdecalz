            <p>Brendan Eich was tasked in 1995 with designing and developing a prototype and programming language for Netscape Navigations' web browser. He completed an initial draft in just 10 days, and that initial document went on to somewhat conquer the world of web development. When it was first released, the draft was called mocha, but in the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, it was renamed livescript, and again in Netscape Navigator 3.0, it was titled JavaScript. It was renamed JavaScript in order to entice Java developers to come and develop on web browsers. The enticement was to help java developers feel more at ease when programming. Microsoft didn't want to lose the browser war to Netscape, so they developed their own programming languages, VBScript and JScript. To add stability to the situation, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International in 1996 in order to develop standards to be implemented, which could then be shared with other browser vendors so that similar functionalities could be implemented. The standardization and organization resulted in the publication of ECMAScript in the ECMA-262 standard release in June 1997, and subsequent version releases of ECMAScript.</p>

            <p>So what is vanilla JavaScript? Vanilla JavaScript is a programming language that may be used without the usage of any libraries or frameworks. Vanilla is a boring, bland, and ordinary word.</p>

            <p>From 2004 to the present, we can observe that the number of searches for JavaScript has been steadily falling, while Python has been steadily increasing. To summarize, this video summarizes the search history of the most widely used programming languages.</p>
